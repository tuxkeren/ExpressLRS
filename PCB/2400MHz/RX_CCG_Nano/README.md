v0.5 PCB
- Initial version


# CCG Nano 2.4 GHz Rx

The ExLRS CCG Nano Rx is 15mm*9.5mm and uses the same pinout as the CRSF Nano.

This PCB uses 0402 SMD components and will require a hot air rework station, plus a microscope to make life easier.

Here is the EasyEDA project containing schematics, PCB design and BOM.
